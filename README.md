# wifi-signal-strength
This model visualizes the spread of wifi signals on a house, and their strength as they travel through air and walls. It is implemented using NetLogo.The model takes into account the mathematical model of Free Space Path Loss, and the attenuation of a wall.

An article about free space path loss can be found in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss

The paper by Davies et al predicts the wireless network signal strength of a building: http://collections.crest.ac.uk/205/1/fulltext.pdf
